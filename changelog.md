General

## v2.1.0 2021-04-23

General

- Fixed bug where a country would deny your ultimatum but lie about it.
- Fixed a bug where a country would accept your ultimatum but not tell you about it.
- When feeding territory to a puppet via focus, you will no longer give them territory that VLT has cored.
  - This is mostly important with SHO, CYC, CHE, and BON where the BON could have cored some stuff that VLT may have wanted to keep.
- The player now has the option to NOT send an ultimatum. An AI controlled VLT will always choose to send an ultimatum to a player controlled country.
- Fixed Vault Federation, maybe?
  - The Vault Federation worked in my playtests, but I don't know if I actually did anything to "fix" it.
- VLT now starts with Tribal Power Armor technology.
- The Power Armor research focus now gives access to Settler Power Armor tech and the Vault-Tec armor, for style points.
  - The armor is barely better than Stripped PA and is worse than Scavenged PA, so I see nothing wrong with giving it to the player.
- New focuses available below the Security tree that grant you access to Advanced technology, once certain requirements are met.
