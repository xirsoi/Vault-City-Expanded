  vault_yakuza: "Pacify the Yakuza"
  vault_yakuza_desc: "The Yakuza are a frustratingly competent criminal organization that somehow survived the Great War and a century of life in the wasteland. Even more vexing is that they control one of the most heavily populated settlements north of New Vegas. It's time we put a stop to that."
  vault_yakuza_serve: "Cut off the Head"

  vault_reno_gangs_desc: "As our influence grows in New Reno it is becoming increasingly apparent that both the lack of an official security apparatus and an abundance of private security in the form of gangs are becoming problematic.

  vault_antelope_slags_desc: "It has come to our attention that a unique community of mutants known as The Slags lives in the area of Modoc, and is largely responsible for it's success in recent decades. These people seem to be the descendants of a group that survived the Great War in a private bunker. A century of life underground and constant low-level exposure to radiation made them adapted to subterranean life. Unfortunately they are all cripplingly agoraphobic as a result. With some help from us, their already good farms could become excellent."
  vault_antelope_militia: "Sharpened Antlers"
  vault_antelope_militia_desc: "With the Antelope Tribe now willing allies it's time to make them useful ones."
  vault_klamath: "The Problem With The Den"

  vault_klamath_den: "Den Crackdown"
  vault_klamath_den_desc: "Now that Klamath's leadership has bent the knee we can crack down on The Den with extreme prejudice. Establishing order and ending the criminal elements should provide some much needed stability, not to mention turning junkies and petty criminals into upstanding members of society."
  vault_klamath_bos_outpost: "The Brotherhood Outpost"
  vault_klamath_bos_outpost_desc: "The Den seems to have an old Brotherhood of Steel outpost. Even before we liberated the region it was nearly abandoned, only a single member occupied it. With it now empty we can renovate and expand it to provide for the defense of the settlement. While we're there it would only be prudent to see if anything useful could be learned from the facility, such as Brotherhood Vertibird schematics..."
  VAULT_FEDERATION: "Vault Federation"
  vault_our_own_way: "Our Own Way"
  vault_our_own_way_desc: "The political landscape of the wasteland has changed dramatically recently, with large power blocs of multiple polities banding together either for self-defense or shared ideology.

  vault_modernize_desc: "Currently Vault City is one of the few civilizations to maintain it's access to advanced technology. Our vassal states, for the most part, are regressive tribal societies, incapable of rediscovering the technology of even the 20th century. It is in our power to elevate them, making them much more useful to us.\n\nThis will, with utmost certainty, cause some culture shock as they adjust to their new reality."

  vault_vegas_vault_data_desc: "New Vegas was the site of multiple Vault-Tec Vaults, at least 3 in the city itself and several in the surrounding wasteland.

  vault_nevada_war_plans: "War Plans Division"
  vault_nevada_war_plans_desc: "The threats that surround the Nevada Pact are numerous and dangerous. To ensure our ability to counter each of them, one of our top researchers came up with a ZAX inspired device he calls a 'Battlemind'.

  vault_first_8buff: "Gauss Weaponry"
  vault_first_8buff_desc: "The secrets of Gauss Weaponry production have eluded our understanding. With the Shi databanks, we may be able to finally crack the secret."

  vault_enclave_5: "The Old World"
  vault_enclave_5_desc: "The Goal of the Enclave has always been, in some form or another, the restoration of Old World America. Returning the shattered wasteland to a state that they deem respectable. They are the guardians of the past, and seek to act as such."
  vault_enclave_6: "New World, Old Ideas"
