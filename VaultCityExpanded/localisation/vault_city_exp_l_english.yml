  vault_reno_leadership: "Local Allies"
  vault_reno_leadership_desc: "New Reno has never had a central authority, being run unofficially by the four competing families in a tense balance.

  vault_east_port_core_desc: "The people of East Port are initially resentful of our occupation, but with some effort we can show them the benefits of being a part of Vault City.

  vault_yakuza: "Pacify the Yakuza"
  vault_yakuza_desc: "The Yakuza are a frustratingly competent criminal organization that somehow survived the Great War and a century of life in the wasteland. Even more vexing is that they control one of the most heavily populated settlements north of New Vegas. It's time we put a stop to that."
  vault_yakuza_serve: "Cut off the Head"

  vault_reno_runners_desc: "New Reno's criminal elements have long been involved in smuggling slaves and medical supplies.

  vault_reno_gangs: "Deputize the Gangs"
  vault_reno_gangs_desc: "As our influence grows in New Reno it is becoming increasingly apparent that both the lack of an official security apparatus and an abundance of private security in the form of gangs are becoming problematic.

  vault_antelope_slags_desc: "It has come to our attention that a unique community of mutants known as The Slags lives in the area of Modoc, and is largely responsible for it's success in recent decades. These people seem to be the descendants of a group that survived the Great War in a private bunker. A century of life underground and constant low-level exposure to radiation made them adapted to subterranean life. Unfortunately they are all cripplingly agoraphobic as a result. With some help from us, their already good farms could become excellent."

  vault_klamath: "The Problem With The Den"

  vault_klamath_den: "Den Crackdown"
  vault_klamath_den_desc: "Now that Klamath's leadership has bent the knee we can crack down on The Den with extreme prejudice. Establishing order and ending the criminal elements should provide some much needed stability, not to mention turning junkies and petty criminals into upstanding members of society."
  vault_klamath_bos_outpost: "The Brotherhood Outpost"
  vault_klamath_bos_outpost_desc: "The Den seems to have an old Brotherhood of Steel outpost. Even before we liberated the region it was nearly abandoned, only a single member occupied it. With it now empty we can renovate and expand it to provide for the defense of the settlement. While we're there it would only be prudent to see if anything useful could be learned from the facility, such as BoS Vertibird schematics..."
